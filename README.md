# learn-laravel
My Laravel learning journey

## The Plan
This was one of the tentatives in the meetup for a hackathon that I joined in March 2019. Laravel was one of the new topic that we wanted to learn. This hack day would motivate us to deepen our knowledge on Laravel. I created a [repository](https://github.com/sisterhood-full-stack-dev/full-stack-journey/blob/master/README.md) for us to gather our resources and references.

There were some ups and downs throughout. The installation and setting up was the most problematic part. Some were using Windows, others were using Linux distros as their OS. I used a Mac OS myself and there were some bumps in the road as well.

Since our hack day was coming to an end, we eventually change the tentative to focus on another topic, which is Advanced PHP. So we focused on studying videos on that topic.

But overall, there were some positive inputs from this experience. I'm including all of them below.


## Resources and Methods
- To be [downloaded](https://app.vagrantup.com/laravel/boxes/homestead/versions/7.1.0/providers/virtualbox.box).
- Install [manual](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48869730/install-manual-for-laravel-homestead-with-virtualbox-box) for laravel homestead with virtualbox.box
- An awesome [course](https://www.udemy.com/php-with-laravel-for-beginners-become-a-master-in-laravel/) from Udemy, taught by Edwin Diaz. It's quite helpful for Windows and Mac users. It is still a work in progress for me, a lot left to be learnt.


## Overall
This is in my soon-to-be-mastered list!
